# changed-areas.sh — classify a changed-file list into the CI jobs it can affect
#
# Reads newline-separated repository paths on stdin (for renames, feed BOTH the
# new and the previous path). Prints exactly two `key=value` lines on stdout, in
# the shape `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` consumes:
#
#   backend=…    run the `backend` job (Rust/Tauri gates in src-tauri/)
#   frontend=…   run the `frontend` job (React/TypeScript gates)
#
# Redline is Linux-only (amdgpu sysfs, lactd, gpu-screen-recorder): there is one
# backend job, on ubuntu-latest.
#
# The `helpers` selector (which gates the `automation` job) is deliberately NOT
# computed here: the automation job runs this script's own tests, so gating it on
# this script's output would let a classifier bug exempt itself. ci.yml always
# sets `helpers=true`.
#
# ci.yml consumes these through `if: … != 'false'`. This script FAILS OPEN:
#
#   * a path no rule recognises sets every flag true, so a new top-level
#     file is tested until someone classifies it here, and
#   * empty input sets every flag true — an empty list means the caller could
#     not produce one, and an unreadable diff must run everything, not nothing.
#
# scripts/test/changed-areas.test.sh pins every rule below.
